# pacMen
Program to inject several img tags in the HTML code and link them to a PacMan image.The program simulates the bouncing of PacMen image tags within the screen.

#howToRun
The program is triggered when clicking on the "Add Pacman" Button and all the animations take place when the "Start Game" button is triggered.

#roadMapforImprovement
The program can be improved by checking the CheckForCollisions function to modify the image source to a more aproppriate picture when the corners are being touched by the pacMan.Also, a setInterval callback can be included to move the pacMan mouth by changing the image source.
